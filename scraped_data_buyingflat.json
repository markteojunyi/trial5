Core members refer to the applicant(s) and occupier(s) who enable the household to qualify for the EC unit purchase under an eligibility scheme. All core members must remain in the EC application, and physically occupy the EC unit during the minimum occupation period (MOP) after the EC unit purchase. Their names cannot be removed.\n\n\n\nHousehold\n\nYour household must comprise 1 of the following groups:\n\nYou and your fiancé or fiancée\nYou and your spouse, and child(ren)\nYou, your parents and siblings. If you are an unmarried/ widowed/ divorced Singapore Citizen (SC) buying an EC with parents, at least 1 of your parents must be a SC or Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR).\nYou and your child(ren) under your legal custody, care and control (for widowed/ divorced persons).

If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious housing subsidies\n\n\nA subsidised housing unit refers to:\n\nA flat bought from HDB\nA resale flat bought on the open market with CPF housing grant(s)\nA Design Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat bought from a property developer\nAn EC unit bought from a property developer\nOther forms of housing subsidy (e.g. enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), privatisation of HUDC estate, etc)\n\n\n\n\nPayment of premium or resale levy\n\nIf you and/ or any core member(s) have taken a housing subsidy, you are considered a second-timer. All second-timer core member(s) will need to pay their respective resale levies, if applicable, when buying an EC unit from the property developer. Find out more on the resale levy payable.\nIf you and/ or any core member(s) have taken 2 housing subsidies, you are not eligible to apply or be listed as a core occupier in an EC application.\n\n\n\n\nOwnership/ Interest in HDB flat\n\n\nIf you or any person listed in the application owns or has an interest in any HDB flat, you must dispose of the interest in the flat, within 6 months of completing your EC unit purchase. This shall be based on the legal completion date of the disposal.\n\n\n\n\nUndischarged bankrupt\n\n\nPrior consent must be obtained from the Official Assignee (OA) or the private trustee for the purchase of an EC unit.\nYou do not need to seek prior consent from the OA or the private trustee if you are listed as an occupier of the EC unit.\n\n\n\nWait-out period before applying to buy an EC unit from a property developer\n\nCancellation of application after booking a flat from HDB\nIf you have booked a flat from HDB and subsequently cancel your flat booking, you must wait out a 1-year period from the date of the cancellation before you may apply or be listed as a core occupier to buy an EC unit from a property developer.\nTermination of the Sale and Purchase Agreement for an EC unit\nIf you had previously bought an EC unit from a property developer with a CPF Housing Grant and subsequently terminated the Sale and Purchase Agreement, you must wait out a 5-year period from the date of the termination before you may apply or be listed as a core occupier to buy an EC unit from a property developer.\nOwners/ Ex-owners of an EC unit bought from a property developer\nIf you currently own or have recently disposed of your ownership in an EC unit, you must wait out a 30-month period from the date of disposal of the EC unit before you may apply or be listed as a core occupier in an application to buy another EC unit from a property developer, subject to other eligibility conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\n\n\nCPF Housing Grants for Executive

Read more on the Citizen Top-Up.\n\n\n\n\nDisposal of existing HDB flat\n\n\nYou and your family members listed in the application for the EC unit must dispose of any interest in any HDB flat, within 6 months of completion of the EC unit purchase. This shall be based on the legal completion date of the disposal.    \n\n\n\n\nMinimum occupation period (MOP)\n\n\nSale of EC unit\nEC units can only be sold on the open market after the 5-year MOP, computed from the date of the Temporary Occupation Permit, has been met.\nCore occupiers in EC unit\nCore occupier(s) enable the household to qualify for an EC unit purchase under an eligibility scheme. All core occupier(s) must remain in the EC application, and physically occupy the EC unit during the MOP after the EC unit purchase. Their names cannot be removed. They also cannot apply or be listed in an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter to buy an HDB flat or EC unit from a property developer during the MOP. \n\n\n\n\nRenting out your EC unit\n\n\nRenting out the whole EC unit\nRenting out the whole EC unit within the 5-year MOP is not allowed.\nRenting out rooms\nYou do not need prior approval from HDB to rent out the bedrooms in your EC unit within the MOP. However, you must register the renting out of bedrooms with HDB within 7 days of doing so. You are also required to notify HDB when you renew or terminate the renting out of bedrooms, and when there are changes to your tenants’ particulars.\n\n\n\n\nInterest in private property\n\n\nYou may invest in private residential property after the 5-year MOP.\n\n\n\n\nBuying your next home\n\n\nYou must meet the requisite wait-out period after disposing of your EC unit on the open market before you may apply to buy an HDB flat.

You will be guided through the following steps for the buying process:\n\nStep 1 and 2: Obtain an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) Letter\nApply for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter on My Flat Dashboard for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. The HFE letter will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.\nYou may request for an In-Principle Approval from the participating financial institutions when you apply for an HFE letter. \nStep 3: Search for a suitable flat and obtain an Option to Purchase (OTP) from flat seller\nAfter obtaining an HFE letter, you may look for a suitable flat that meets your budget and household needs.\nBrowse resale flat listings on the HDB Flat Portal. Read our guide on finding a flat for more information on the Resale Flat Listing (RFL) service and other resources you can use to help plan and prepare for your flat purchase.\nYou can either manage the purchase on your own or engage the service of a salesperson for a fee.  Please read managing the flat purchase and consider signing up for our resale seminars to learn more about resale policies and procedures.\nObtain an Option to Purchase (OTP) from the flat seller* after you have agreed on the flat price.\n* Sellers must have registered an Intent to Sell for more than 7 days.\nStep 4: Confirm mode of financing\nIf you intend to get an HDB housing loan, you will need a valid HFE letter^ from HDB before flat sellers may grant you an OTP.\nIf you have indicated that you intend to get an HDB housing loan in your HFE application, the loan outcome will be reflected in your HFE letter accordingly.\nIf you have indicated that you intend to get a housing loan from a financial institution in your HFE application, you must have a valid Letter of Offer (LO) before you exercise the OTP. You may concurrently request an In-Principle Approval and LO from participating financial institutions when applying for the HFE letter^ on My Flat Dashboard.\n^ Refer to Steps 1 and 2 to determine if you need a valid HFE letter.\nStep 5: Submit Request for Value\nIf you are paying for the flat purchase with CPF savings and/ or housing loan, submit a Request for Value by the next working day after you get the OTP.\nThis is not required if you are not using your CPF savings and any housing loan to pay for the flat purchase.\nStep 6: Convert In-Principle Approval (IPA) into a Letter of Offer (LO)\nIf you have requested for an IPA while applying for the HFE letter, you can convert the IPA into an LO at this step, before exercising the OTP during the Option Period.\nStep 7: Submit resale application\nAfter you exercise the OTP, you and the sellers must submit the respective portions of the resale application.\nStep 8 and 9: Acknowledge resale documents and pay fees\nUpon receiving a complete resale application and the full set of supporting documents from you and the sellers, we will verify the eligibility of both parties and accept the resale application within 28 working days. We will prepare the necessary documents for you and the sellers to endorse, which will be ready about 3 weeks after the application has been accepted. You and the sellers must acknowledge and endorse the resale documents, and pay the necessary fees.\nStep 10: Get resale approval\nAfter the documents are endorsed and fees paid, HDB will grant an approval for the resale transaction.\nStep 11: Attend completion appointment\nResale completion is about 8 weeks from the date of HDB’s acceptance of the resale application. This is the earliest possible date to complete the transaction. If you wish to defer the completion, please discuss with your sellers and let us have a written confirmation (signed by both sellers and buyers) via MyRequest@HDB. You and the sellers will be notified via SMS of the appointment. You may also log in to My Flat Dashboard for the appointment details.\n\n \n\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\n\n\nApplication for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) Letter\n    \n\n\nFind out more about the HFE letter and how to apply for one to confirm your eligibility. You may also concurrently apply for an In-Principle Approval from the financial institutions for a housing loan.\n    \n\n\n\nPlan, Source and Contract\n\nFind out about the mode of financing,

Details such as flat types, classification of the flats on offer and pricing, will be available during the sales exercise. If you wish to be notified of the sales exercises, subscribe to HDB eAlert Service. You may also read our frequently asked questions on sales exercise.\nApplicants may be eligible for the various priority schemes to increase their chances of getting a flat. Nevertheless, to discourage non-selection of flats and prioritise applicants who are in urgent need to buy a flat, application restrictions will apply if you choose not to book a BTO or SBF flat when you are invited to do so.\nAdditionally, BTO/ SBF applicants who have received a queue position that is within the flat supply will not be eligible to apply for a flat in subsequent sales exercises until after their flat booking appointment. This is to give other applicants a chance to secure a flat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Build-To-Order (BTO)\r\n                        \n\r\n                            The BTO system offers you flexibility in location and timing of your flat purchase. A BTO sales launch offers a range of flat types across a few towns.\r\n                        \nArrow down icon\n\n\n\nHow the BTO process works\nThe flat types offered are typically Community Care Apartments, 2-room Flexi, 3-, 4-, 5-room and 3Gen flats. You may apply for your preferred flat type and town, and balloting will be conducted to determine whether your flat application is successful.\nFirst-timer families enjoy higher priority for BTO flats. In cases where the applicants comprise a first-timer and second-timer, the couple will be treated as a first-timer family, with the same priority benefits and privileges.\nHere is an overview of the BTO process:\n\nDistribution of flat supply\nMore new flats are allocated to first-timer families as they have a more pressing need for a home.\nFor seniors, at least 40%# of the 2-room Flexi public flat supply across Standard, Plus and Prime projects will be set aside for them. Within this, half in Standard and Plus projects and a quarter in Prime projects will be set aside for eligible seniors under the Senior Priority Scheme (SPS). Those who are unsuccessful under the seniors quota will be included in a second round of ballot with other applicants for the balance flat supply. On the other hand, any unused seniors quota will be distributed among the other households.\n# Subject to a minimum of 100 units for each BTO project\nFor second-timer families, up to 15% of the public flat supply will be set aside for them. If there are more second-timer families than the flat supply set aside for them, not all of them will be successful in their flat application, in keeping them within the flat supply set aside for them.\nBTO flat distribution for non-seniors for Standard flats\n\n\n\nFlat Type\nFirst-timer\nSecond-timer\n\n\nFamilies (FPPS)^\nFamilies (MCPS)*\nOther families\nSingles\nFamilies (ASSIST)\nFamilies (MCPS)*\nOther families\n\n\n\n\n2-room Flexi\n10%\n5%\n5%\n65%\n5%\n5%\n5%\n\n\n3-room\n40%\n30%\n15%\nNA\n5%\n5%\n5%\n\n\n4-room and bigger\n40%\n30%\n25%\nNA\nNA\n3%\n2%\n\n\n\nFPPS – Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme\nMCPS – Married Child Priority Scheme\nASSIST – Assistance Scheme for Second-Timers (Divorced/Widowed Parents)\n^ Within the FPPS quota, first priority is given to FT(PMC)s who apply for a 4-room or smaller Standard flat.\n* Within the MCPS quota, first priority is given to applicants who apply for a flat to live together with their parents/ married child.\nBTO flat distribution for non-seniors for Plus flats\n\n\n\nFlat Type\nFirst-timer\nSecond-timer\n\n\nFamilies (FPPS)\nFamilies (MCPS)*\n\nOther families\nSingles\nFamilies (MCPS)*\nOther families\n\n\n\n\n2-room Flexi\n10%\n5%\n5%\n65%\n3%\n2%\n\n\n3-room and bigger \n40%\n30%\n25%\nNA\n3%\n2%\n\n\n\nFPPS – Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme\nMCPS – Married Child Priority Scheme\n* Within the MCPS quota, first priority is given to applicants who apply for a flat to live together with their parents/ married child.\nBTO flat distribution for non-seniors for Prime flats\n\n\n\nFlat Type\nFirst-timer\nSecond-timer\n\n\nFamilies (FPPS)\nFamilies (MCPS)*\n\nOther families\nSingles\nFamilies (MCPS)*\nOther families\n\n\n\n\n2-room Flexi\n10%\n3%\n7%\n65%\n2%\n13%\n\n\n3-room and bigger \n40%\n20%\n35%\nNA\n2%\n3%\n\n\n\nFPPS – Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme\nMCPS – Married Child Priority Scheme\n* Within the MCPS quota, first priority is given to applicants who apply for a flat to live together with their parents/ married child.\nAllocation of ballot chances\n\n\n\nHousehold Status\nNo. of Ballot Chances\n\n\n\n\nFirst-Timer (Parents & Married Couples) [FT(PMC)]\n3\n\n\nOther first-timer families/ couples\n2\n\n\nSecond-timer families\n1\n\n\nFirst-timer singles\n1\n\n\n\nAdditional ballot chances after 2 unsuccessful applications\nAll first-timers, including FT(PMC)s, will get 1 additional chance for every subsequent unsuccessful BTO application for a Standard flat, after they have been unsuccessful for 2 or more BTO applications (as a first-timer family) for Standard flats.\n\n\n\n\nNo. of Previous Unsuccessful BTO Applications for Standard Flats\n\n\nAdditional Chances[1]\n(+1 per BTO application for Standard flats after 2 unsuccessful BTO applications for Standard flats)\n\n\nTotal Chances[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n0 to 1\n0\n2\n\n\n2\n1\n3\n\n\n3\n2\n4\n\n\n4\n3\n4\n\n\n\nNote: The table above is an illustration for a typical non-FT(PMC) first-timer family.\n[1] The count of unsuccessful BTO attempts will be refreshed with effect from the Oct 2024 sales exercise.

The flat types offered are typically Community Care Apartments, 2-room Flexi, 3-, 4-, 5-room, Executive flats, and 3Gen flats. The flats are usually already under construction, near completion or completed.\nThere is often strong interest in SBF flats, and the chances of getting a flat are slim. For a better chance to secure a flat, please apply for a BTO flat in Standard projects.\nFirst-timer families enjoy higher priority for SBF flats. In cases where the applicants comprise a first-timer and second-timer, the couple will be treated as a first-timer family, with the same priority benefits and privileges.\nHere is an overview of the SBF process:\n\nDistribution of flat supply\nMore flats are allocated to first-timer families as they have a more pressing need for a home.\nFor seniors, at least 40% of the 2-room Flexi public flat supply across Standard, Plus and Prime projects will be set aside for them.

The HFE letter will provide you with a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to buy a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.\nYou may read our frequently asked questions on sales exercises. After a sales launch is announced, you can apply for a flat online at the HDB Flat Portal during the application period. An non-refundable administrative fee of $10 (inclusive of GST) per application is payable by credit card (MasterCard/ Visa) or scanning the QR code using any of the supporting mobile payment apps.\n\nAt the end of the application period, HDB will place all eligible applications through a computerised ballot to determine the queue order to book the flats. For first-timer families, as their flat allocation quota is at least a specified percentage, they can receive queue numbers bigger than the flat supply set aside for them. HDB will inform all applicants of the outcome of their application. You may check the status of your application when the ballot result is announced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Priority schemes\r\n                        \n\r\n                            We have several priority schemes to help different groups of flat buyers with their housing needs. \r\n                        \nArrow down icon\n\n\n\nFor first-timer applicants and those with more urgent housing needs, there are priority schemes in place to enhance your chances in the computer ballot for flats offered in the Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) sales exercises.

You may also read our frequently asked questions on the HFE letter.\nIncome guidelines\nHDB considers the incomes of all persons listed in your HFE letter application to assess your household’s eligibility to buy a flat, receive CPF housing grants and take an HDB housing loan. \n\n\n\nAssessment\nGuideline\n\n\n\n\nPeriod of income assessment\n12 months\n\n\nEnd of assessment period\n\n2 months preceding the month of HFE letter application^\n^ For example, if your HFE letter application is submitted in May 2024, the assessment period will be from April 2023 to March 2024.\nNote:\nYou must be working at the point of the HFE letter application to be considered for an Enhanced CPF Housing Grant and HDB housing loan.\nApplicant(s) taking an HDB housing loan must remain in their employment or trade when HDB disburses the housing loan.\n\n\n\nComputation of income\n\nThe average gross monthly income for each applicant and/ or occupier is the total income earned over the number of months worked during the assessment period. The incomes of all persons (both applicants and occupiers) listed in the HFE letter application are included in the assessment.\nFor self-employed persons, the number of months worked will be 12 or from business commencement during the assessment period. \nFor employed persons, the number of months worked will exclude months on no-pay leave (treated as unemployment) or from employment commencement during the assessment period. For example, if you worked for 10 months during the income assessment period, your average income earned will be the total income earned for the 10 months divided by 10.\nTo illustrate, the average gross monthly household income will be computed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nApplicant \n                        1\nApplicant \n                        2\n\nApplicant \n                        3\n\n\n\n\nTotal gross income during the assessment period\n$A\n$B\n$C\n\n\nNumber of months worked\n12\n6\n10\n\n\nAverage gross monthly income\n\n$A / 12 = $X\n$B / 6 = $Y\n$C / 10 = $Z\n\n\n\nAverage gross monthly household income\n$X + $Y + $Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome components\nAll components from employment or trade, including employee’s CPF deductions and excluding employer’s CPF contributions and bonuses.\n\n\n\nTypes of income/ allowance considered for assessment of household income and credit assessment:\n\n\n\n\n            Types of Income/ Allowance\n Considered for\n\n\nAssessment of household income\nCredit assessment for HDB housing loan\n\n\n\n\nApplicant’s income\n\nYes\nYes\n\n\nOccupier’s income\nYes\nNo\n\n\nAllowances/ overtime pay e.g. allowances for food, transport, laundry, uniform, shift work, etc.\n Yes\n            \n\n\nClaims / reimbursements\n\n\nDirector’s fee\n\n\nEmployees’ benefits e.g. birthday incentives, marriage tokens, etc.\n\n\nIncentives\n\n\nOverseas cost of living allowances for working persons\n\n\nPupillage/ stipends\n\n\nEmployer’s CPF contributions\n No\n            \n\n\nBonuses\n\n\nAnnual Wage Supplement\n\n\nEmployees’ share options and other non-monetary remuneration\n\n\nNational Service allowance\n\n\nOverseas allowances for applicants on scholarship\n\n\nPension\n\n\nNot related to employment and trade, e.g. rental income, alimony/ maintenance fee, and dividend income/ interest from fixed deposit/ savings accounts.\n\n\n\nDocuments\nWhen you apply for an HFE letter, you will be guided to retrieve your information from Myinfo to minimise form-filling and submission of documents.
